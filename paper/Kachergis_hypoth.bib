@article{Lyon:2012,
	Abstract = {The advent of humanoid robots has enabled a new approach to investigating the acquisition of language, and we report on the development of robots able to acquire rudimentary linguistic skills. Our work focuses on early stages analogous to some characteristics of a human child of about 6 to 14 months, the transition from babbling to first word forms. We investigate one mechanism among many that may contribute to this process, a key factor being the sensitivity of learners to the statistical distribution of linguistic elements. As well as being necessary for learning word meanings, the acquisition of anchor word forms facilitates the segmentation of an acoustic stream through other mechanisms. In our experiments some salient one-syllable word forms are learnt by a humanoid robot in real-time interactions with naive participants. Words emerge from random syllabic babble through a learning process based on a dialogue between the robot and the human participant, whose speech is perceived by the robot as a stream of phonemes. Numerous ways of representing the speech as syllabic segments are possible. Furthermore, the pronunciation of many words in spontaneous speech is variable. However, in line with research elsewhere, we observe that salient content words are more likely than function words to have consistent canonical representations; thus their relative frequency increases, as does their influence on the learner. Variable pronunciation may contribute to early word form acquisition. The importance of contingent interaction in real-time between teacher and learner is reflected by a reinforcement process, with variable success. The examination of individual cases may be more informative than group results. Nevertheless, word forms are usually produced by the robot after a few minutes of dialogue, employing a simple, real-time, frequency dependent mechanism. This work shows the potential of human-robot interaction systems in studies of the dynamics of early language acquisition.},

4afc test
2x2: learned 16.2
3x3: learned 13.6
4x4: learned 9.5

Exp. 2 of Yu {\&}amp; Smith (in press--08? 07?)
4x4: 9 pairs, 8 reps; 9 pairs, 12 reps; 18 pairs, 6 reps
same proportion learned; more pairs learned in 18/6 than 9/12 (9.5 vs 5.5)

citation: mutual exclusivity (Markman, 1990) - 
contrast (Clark, 1987) - 
human learners as selective associative learners with competition, inhibition, and attention shifting processes (e.g., Kruschke, 2001)
i should read Siskind 1996

models considered:
hypothesis testing: maintain list of hypothesized pairs, and a count of the {\#} of times each pair is hypothesized (i say this makes it a noisy, sparse co-occ matrix)
- if a pair is hypothesized t time, it is put into a dictionary and used to filter future hypotheses
(why such huge error bars on the 5000 simulated Ss?)

dumb associative: store 1, 2 or 3 random w-o assocs per trial, and choose strongest associated o for each w at test (2 pairs/trial provides best fit)

associative translation model: assume that there are latent menaings that both languages point to, and we can discover these structures from statistical regularities -- use (Brown, Pietra, Pietra, {\&}amp; Mercer, 1994) and EM -- details in (Yu, Ballard, {\&}amp; Aslin, 2005) - 1 or 2 pairs per trial, 2 pairs gives best fit (but overperforms in 4x4 case)

unified view: relevant mechanisms are nearly the same: 1) what info is stored on any given trial, 2) how past knowledge constrains future learning, 3) how accrued info is evaluated

error-driven learning, which forms the basis of most formal learning models (e.g., Barlow, 2001; Gallistel {\&}amp; Gibbon, 2000; Pearce {\&}amp; Hall, 1980; Rescorla {\&}amp; Wagner, 1972; Rumelhart, Hinton, {\&}amp; McClelland, 1986)

when objects predict labels, the features of those object compete for relevance, so the features that are most predictive of each label (and thus discriminate the labels) are highlighted

when labels predict objects, the sparse features of labels inhibit competitive discrimination learning ...hrrrrm

- suggests language is a fundamentally predictive process

philosophy stuff:
	- reference presupposes that the relationship bw symbols and meanings is bidirectional
	- however, abstraction is not bidirectional: it is reduction of information content so that only the info relevant for some purpose is retained (i.e., info is discarded)
	- thus, their approach is *not* referential, but is predictive: from cues to an expectation

error-driven learning: cues compete for relevance -- shaped both by positive evidence (co-occurrences of cues and predicted events) and negative evidence (lack of occurrences)

children prefer to map novel names to novel objects (rather than to familiar ones for which a name is already known) (Markman, 1990)

"because their experiment averaged across words and participants and may have only tested the associations betwen any given word and a single object, it was not possible to determine whether the lexicons participants learned were consistent with mutual exclusivity"

- covering constraints ...

- exlclusivity: "children apply principles of exclusivity to constrain the possible meanings of some words in an utterance, given knowledge about the meanings of other words in that utterance"

Children face the bootstrapping problem: they must begin to learn their first language with no prior knowledge of the language (Pinker, 1984; Gleitman, 1990).

Fisher et al. 1994 named it cross-situational learning

we deal with at least 3 of the things that make language learning hard (according to Siskind): multi-word utterances, referential uncertainty, and bootstrapping

the model's learning accelerates as more is learned (since it can use other forms of inference), and can ultimately learn words after only 1-2 occurrences with no "maturational parameter shift"

homonymy (1 word, multiple meanings)
- when it detects noise, hypothesizes splitting a word to have two referents (that is, a special mechanism for homonyms -- will only work if sufficient noise detected)},
